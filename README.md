## Documentation

You can find the source of the data that I have used for my analysis on the following site: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

## Project motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to 2019 to better understand:

- what is the situation of women in Italy in the programming world compared to man?
- what is the identikit of women who work in computer programming in Italy? What are their qualifications?
- Instead in USA, what is the situation of super qualified women in techÂ ?

# Result 

Thanks to this analysis I observed not only that the number of women in Computer Progrogramming is very low, but I also discover that
only women who are super qualified(i.e. they have a bachelor's degree, a master's degree or a PhD) try to take part in this field. That means there are a huge number of women who don't know this world because of cultural stereotype and exclusion.

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here.]()
